Final-paper-for-AST-514
=======

This is my midterm paper (in LaTeX) for Princeton University's AST 514 course, 
"Structure of the Stars." I wrote about s- and r-process nucleosynthesis, including a discussion on possible r-process occurrence sites.

Fun fact: since I wrote this paper, the problem of the r-process occurrence sites has been solved!  Observations in light and gravitational waves of a merging neutron star binary confirms that such events are the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe.
