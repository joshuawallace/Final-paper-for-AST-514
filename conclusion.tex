Although the existence of the r- and s-process has been recognized for
over 50 years the exact sites where these processes happen are still
not certain. Much of theory and observation point to a few sites: low
mass AGB stars and high mass He core burning stars for the s-process,
proto-neutron stars or merging neutron stars for the r-process;
however lack of full understanding of the relevant nuclear and stellar
physics as well as direct observational evidence for all but low
mass AGB stars keep us from knowing for certain.  Increasingly
powerful computer simulations will allow us to constrain things more
fully on the theory side.  Should the Galaxy be obliging in the next
few years, direct nearby observations of either a core collapse
supernova or neutron star merger can also provide direct evidence for
the r-process site.  Whether or not we are that lucky, the field of
nucleosynthesis will likely continue to be a fertile and productive
field of research in the years to come.
